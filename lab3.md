***What is a growth mindset??***

A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort.
The growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

I have the growth mindset for:
- **Challenges:_Embraces_.** 
- **Obstacles:_persists_.** 
- **Effort:_No pain;no gain_.**
