## What is git?
1- Snapshots.
2- Local Operations.
3- Tracking Changes.
4- Loss of Data.
5- States.

### We also have on git:
- Committed
_Data is securely stored in a local database_

- Modified
_File has been changed but not committed to the database_

- Staged
_Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot_

#### **We have to clone every things on git to start work with github**

### Saving Changes
- Tracked
Tracked files can be modified, unmodified, or staged; they were part of the most recent file snapshot.

- Untracked
Untracked files were not in the last snapshot and do not currently reside in the staging area.

### This is how to Pushing Changes on ubuntu

***$ git push origin master***
